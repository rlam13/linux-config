# fdisk -l /dev/hda
// locate the device containing your / partition (the example assumes it is located in the master position of the Primary IDE controller)

# mount /dev/hdaX /mnt
// Once you find out which device contains your / partition, mount it somewhere

# mount -o bind /dev /mnt/dev
# mount -o bind /proc /mnt/proc
